          <div class="no-account-text thin middle">The service provides secure, hosted Loki accounts in order to provide easy access to funds for those that would prefer not to run a full Loki client themselves, or for those on devices with limited resources. You can access your account on any device, as long as you have access to your private login key. The service never knows your private login key, and is thus unable to spend your funds without your authorisation. All of the private cryptography is done locally on your device.</div>
